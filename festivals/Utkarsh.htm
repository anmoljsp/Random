	Utkarsh is a National level Hindi festival in which teams from cities around kurukshetra and teams of other institutes of kurukshetra participate in singing and dancing events apart from the students of NIT Kurukshetra. Its flagship event Mr. and Miss. Utkarsh is a contest to find the most talented boy and girl of the college and the word 'talent' has no boundaries. Its a relatively a very small festival and despite having a lot of events across the weekend, it for large fails to capture your imagination and you won't even know if a fest is taking place in the college at all.<br>
	But the first year students are highly proactive in this event and enjoy it to the fullest being their first fest of the college. It also prepares them for, in a way, Talent Show that just succeeds it. But the difference in the magnitude of the fests can be boile to the fact that only a single society organizes the whole festival while all the major clubs host the Talent Show. Still the biggest positive for Utkarsh is it is actually getting bigger and better each year and it has grown in magnitude leaps and bounds but the growth of other festivals too undermine its change.<br>
	Even still it is a festival to enjoy for the first year students and like a starter before the main course begins. And it offers the only event in your entire college life where boys and girls are allowed to be together even after the curfew time, though the students of the college have repeatedly shown they are not worthy of the leisure afforded.</p>
