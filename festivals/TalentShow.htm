Talent Show is in all fairness the first fest that each Student of NIT Kurukshetra get to be a part of. Being an exclusive evnet for the first year helps the new scholars to open up to the college, its culture and its members.

It's your chance to become the first <i>hawabaaz</i> of your year and to show off your skills and talents.<br>
Those who are great at dancing or singing or even acting have a host of events they can take part in. Even those who are more inclined towards academics, many are infirst year, don't have adearth of contests they can take part in. It's just about finding the correct event for you. Moreover, your performance does influence and helps you while the inductions for the various clubs which just succeed the fest.<br>
The flagship event of the fest, Mr. and Miss Fresher, conducted by MAD aims at identifying the person who has the abilities and the persona to represent his whole year and can hold his/her in the most adverse conditions as well. Apart from these events, there are indeed fun events and informals going on in the AE Lawns.
