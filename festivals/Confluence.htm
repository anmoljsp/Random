Regardeless of how anyone percieves the college, whatever they think of its culture and its educational and recreational ideologies, one thing that everyone will agree to is that Confluence is indeed the grandest fest in the whole of Northern India leaving aside the NCR. Its a festival which you can know is actually happening with almost everyone involved in its conduction. With decorations to external publicities to flash mobs to the advertisement flexes of the sponsors to the exquisite graffitis painted by the Fine Arts club, you can see the college transform and turn into a stage where each person displays his or her own art in his/her own style.<br>
It's actually a national level event as team from national level actually attend the fest making it a highly competetive and closely contested affair. But the reputation of the fest is somewhat tainted since teams from outside often complain of plain bias which is quite visible on many occasions. This has lead to fewer participation from external teams and making great events like groove armada and nukkad natak seem insignificant due to the treatment metted out to the external teams.<br>
Apart from its shortcomings, its a festival that brings the college alive and the atmosphere in AE lawns is absolutely electric. The biggest attraction of the fest is undoubtedly the Star Night. Several established singers and bands have performed on the biggest night of the college over the years and the level of Confluence has been rising year after year and the incoming first year is directly responsible for the growth and success of any fest.
