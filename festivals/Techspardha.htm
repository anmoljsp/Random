Techspardha is the annual techno-managerial fest of our college and is a national level festival which witnesses participation from teams mainly from northern India. The event acts as a trigger to your technical mind and initiates you towards the technical aspects of the college life. It is managed by all the technical societies of the college and even though participation is limited to northern part of the countries, the level that the college possesses and some tough competetion from the colleges of Delhi and Chandigarh ensure it to be a mega fest.<br>
The fest isn't one that will grab your eye balls or one by which you would be highly enthralled. It actually is a fest where the only way to enjoy the fest is to participate and to be active. Its a national event so having participated in Altius gives you a pretty high edge when you are competing at Techspardha. The level of events such as RoboWars, Contraption, Autonomia, junkyard and coding events like Black Box and Encoder are of much high competetiveness and calibre.<br>
And the most important thing to remember always is that winning doesn't matter. If you participate in a new event, you learn something new each time and more than anything else, it helps building your intrest in a particular field.
