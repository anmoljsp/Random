They conduct workshops throughout the year with the Auto-CAD workshop being their main workshop.
During Techspardha, they usually have paper and presentation events as well as business plans. They offer you a great opportunity to participate as these are good events to start building your technical skill set. Apart from them, they conduct a couple of fun events which you can participate in while having a blast.
