<p style="font-family:chiller;color:white;font-size:30px;"><b><font color="red" size="120%">SUC(Street Underconstruction Crew)- </font></b>The other freestylers, for long they have been the club that wins more and was best by a considerable margin. But the amount of hard work that LSD has put in has certainly covered up all the gap. This year, their performances have been riddled with mistakes and often had to rely on the individual brilliance of its dancers.<BR>
This quite visible lack of practice hasn’t stopped them from bringing laurels to the college and they have bounced back after Confluence and won a couple of events outside the college. Still with all considerations, there's absolutely nothing separating the two groups and it all comes down to who can deliver at the moment.
