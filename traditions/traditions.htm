<p><b>Traditions-</b></p>
<p>1. Calling seniors Sir and Ma'am: Well the reason is nothing. We ourselves don't know why it is but the reason we were being given are that you are being prepared for your life after college when you have to call every one of your senior sir. Well that sounds quite ridiculous actually so we have a more real reason as well being that if you call your male seniors bhaiya and female seniors didi, they become siblings. Well it too is a very shoddy reason but then we usually have absurd reasons for all of our traditions.</p>
<p>2.Belter(this one's painful)- So there's a tradition that anyone whose placement takes place is belted corresponding to his package (18lacs-18belt shots........ Per person). So all those who are here for Google and Facebook, start gyming.
And people take full advantage of this and take out their personal grudges and this show of shows happens in the middle of the market usually... It's mostly wherever you can catch up with the running guy. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!</p>
<p>3.BIRTHDAYs- Well we don't have b'day bombs in here. We are not that sophisticated. We prefer the belt shots and kicks more and unlike above, there's no count. You are at the mercy of your hooligan turned friends.
And though its a tradition that establishes itself, we want to request you not to waste the sumptuous chocolaty delicacy on somebody's face.</p>
<p>4. B'day treats- Well we believe in give and take so the deal usually is that the friends give the bday bash to the guy/gal at midnight on his birthday. It's a contri based party with only the people who are willing to empty their pockets being invited. Later that day follows a party from the birthday boy/girl at a venue of his choice with people of HIS CHOICE. So it can get pretty tricky.. :p</p>
<p>5. Demand week- The penultimate week of the even semester is celebrated á the demand week. Being followed by last end semesters for the final year, it is celebrated as the farewell week for them. Thus as a tribute and farewell to our living seniors we fulfill their wishes for all the week. Usually clubs and societies give their seniors their last salute and different clubs and societies could be seen celebrating demand day in the market. Some clubs like Sac and photog rather command quite an audience.They usually involves dressing, modeling, dancing, proposing and a hell lot of fun and some things which we can just not write.</p>
<p>6. Order of hierarchy: Well it all boil downs to the parties at the end in the college and when taking about parties there is an order of hierarchy to giving away the goods. The first yearites are the happiest lot since you can take parties form ask the rest the years and especially the final year. Though most parties are given from your immediate senior year but we request you to don't spare the prefi and final in any way.. :p</p>
<p>7. NO RAGGING:The campus follows full ragging free environment and is completely fill with love for the upcoming year. Some healthy funny exchange between seniors and juniors is always there and it is with all the years not just first. Even then, if anyhow you feel like someone has ragged you or has affected you somehow, you can inform us at the given email id with the details of the incident. But we can promise you, you won't be writing many mails.
