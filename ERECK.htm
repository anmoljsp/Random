It pretty much has the same priorities, obligations, functions and duties. It, too, undertakes the successful conduct or events of the electrical departments. They also control the Info-Desk where all the information regarding the fest can be gathered by students from outside and within the college.<br>
It offers you with the best events which can be targeted by first yearites. The first one is Alpha Quest and the other is a PCM quiz, exclusively for the first year, to check your scientific acumen. They do pretty much all the rest of the things as well, contributing mainly to the common deco and hosting Informal events.
