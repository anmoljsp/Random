<font color="red" size="120%">HLAD(Hindi Literary and Debating Club):</font>
<p style="font-family:chiller;color:white;font-size:30px;"> They are the desi brothers of ELAD. They do all the things I mentioned above just in Hindi. Their flagship event for the Talent Show is Talaash-e-kohinoor, a hindi counterpart of Mr and Miss Freshers, the flagship event of MAD at Talent Show.<br>
They conduct a workshop with the name of SUC which covers all the facets that you would require during your placements and internships. Though that stage is some three years away but it builds your confidence and opens you up to others. It is a total value for money thing…a paisa wasool.<br>
