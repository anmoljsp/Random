Though most people would ask you to avoid GTs and stay away from them if you want to lead a peacefull and non-violent college life; there are some GTs where you would be forcedfully called. Mostly you can politely decline but its best to avoid if you don't want to join. Some GTs like UPGT are too agressive and your life their can be quite rough. So if you are not someone who likes to pick up a fight, STAY AWAY!
