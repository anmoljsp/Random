<font color="red" size="120%">SHIKSHA:</font><p style="font-family:chiller;color:white;font-size:30px;"> It is litearlly a step towards enligtening the world of darkness. Those who have earned must repay their debts. The society believes that everyone is entitled to a quality education. They are a bunch of students who are willing to take a hour out of their schedule couple of days a week from roaming in the market to spending it with the lesser fortunate children who can't afford private tutions. More than a hundred students are taught all the subjects of their curriculum by the volunteers.<br>
They want to share their knowledge with those who wouldn't be normally having the privelledge to study the details of their curriculum and the joy on the faces of these children more than repays the effort put in by the volunteers. As mentioned, it is not a full-fledged society but in hand with Rooh and Art of Living.
