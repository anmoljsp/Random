The smaller brother of Techspardha, Altius is the intra-NITK festival of the college offering the first, second and third years a chance to hone and develop their technical skills to be able to compete with the beat and the rest at Techspardha. The events conducted are all same as the events conducted on techspardha and are more of a preparatory course.<br>
The festival has very less to offer on recreational front and you will only enjoy if you are participating in some events and the best part about these technical events is their is no boundation of branch and if you are intrested in a field which doesn't come under your branch domain, you can still learn that thing while at the same time participating.<br>
Not only the technical events, the sevral paper presentation events help you in preparation for your company placement interviews and for your GATE and CAT exams. Offcourse each event does include some fun events to capture the imagination of the students. So there are various informals events and some fun events also take place like Amazing race. But the biggest problem with the fest is that people are not too interested in it and most go home in the vacations which is highly not recommended. All fests whether cultural or technical cater to your various needs and skills and develop those. So it is a cardinal sin to miss any of them.
