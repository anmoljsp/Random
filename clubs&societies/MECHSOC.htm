<font color="red" size="120%">MECHSOC:</font><p style="font-family:chiller;color:white;font-size:30px;"> Arguably the biggest and grandest events of the Techspardha all belong to them. They are the official society of Mechanical department, the boys department of course. The mechanical department of the college is superb and comes right behind computers. The events conducted by them see the most participation from both within and outside of the college.<br>
Events like contraption, Robo-wars, Roll-a-coaster are some of the exceptional events which not only invite the most participation but also those which invite the most audience.  These are all team events and though first yearites are at a slight disadvantage in these events, but you could take inspiration from your seniors as the contraption was won by a first year team last time.<br>
They also conduct a variety of workshops with Solidworks and robotics workshop being some of their main workshops but the EMR workshop on robotics would be a much better option for you.
