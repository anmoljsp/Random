<p style="font-family:chiller;color:white;font-size:30px;"><b><font color="red" size="120%">GAWDS(Graphics And Web Development Squad)- </font></b> <br>Technobyte aside, this is the group of computer department in its true form. They are the bunch of the finest and the most talented web developers of the college. Though it isn’t entirely true to say that all the best coders are with this squad, but still they boast of some of the best the college has up its sleeves.<br>
They are behind all the websites of the college festivals. They don’t hold any events during the festivals like technobyte, but they host and maintain the websites of <a href="http://www.techspardha.org/" class="class3" target="_new">Techspardha</a> and <a href="http://www.conflu.org/" class="class3" target="_new">Confluence</a>. To know the expertise and professionalism of their work you can check their websites of Confluence and Techspardha.<br>
They have three divisions: Graphic designing, Web development and android app development. Out of the three, their graphic designing and web development wings are phenomenal and are equal to most of the challenges a professional designer faces. They also conduct a couple of workshops, usually in the even semester.
