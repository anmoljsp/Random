<font color="red" size="120%">SAE(Society for Automotive Engineers):</font><p style="font-family:chiller;color:white;font-size:30px;"> Undoubtedly the best society you have in the campus, they are men who toil in the night and sweat in the morning. They are the only society who rivals the IITs at the national scene. They make three different types of teams: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/teamnitrox/" target="_new" class="class3">Nitrox</a>, a baja building team ranked 20th amongst the top 327 colleges ; <a href="https://www.facebook.com/teamaccelerons/" target="_new" class="class3">Accelerons</a>, a Formula 1 car and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/teamibridosaenitkkr/?fref=ts" target="_new" class="class3">Ibrido</a>, a utility vehicle for the physically challenged people,efficycle.<BR>
Baha has been the most successful of the three and oldest as well. But reaching the club in itself is a toil. You need to pass through a series of Personal interviews, Technical Interviews, written exams and practical knowledge.<BR>
So be prepared for it and if you are interested in automobiles or have any inclination towards cars, do attend their workshop <a href="https://www.facebook.com/autokriti/" target="_new" class="class3">AUTOKRITI</a>. It is the most comprehensive guide to a car’s functioning. Those who have attended it call it the best workshop of all.
