<font size=120% color=red>SAC(Student's Activity Club)-</p>
<p style="font-size:30px;font-family:chiller;color:white;"> Beginning with arguably the biggest and grandest of them all(we may be biased as we are a part of it…:p),SAC is the club which manages the flagship event of the CONFLUENCE, the <a class="class1" href="../images/starnyt1.jpg" target="_self">Star Night</a> and <a class="class1" href="../images/informals.jpg" target="_self">the Informals</a>. You can know more about the fests and all the events in the FESTIVALS section. The budget allocated for star night is not huge and its mostly funded by the sponsorships accumulated by the clubs. Last year,90% of the sponsorships of the fest came through SAC.<br>
It also hosts the Informals stage which is now also being shared by all the other clubs. The Informals are held in AE lawns. You can find it in a festive mode in the evening with the tunes of DJ running through everyone. It’s the place to be if you are in the college during Confluence. It also helps Fine arts in the common deco of the fest along with MAD. It also conducts workshop on Vedic Maths each year which could be quite helpful.<br>
