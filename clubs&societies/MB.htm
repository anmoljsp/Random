The society is behind the various ECE events that you are going to be participating in at Techspardha. Their events are rather diverse and can be participated in by students across branches.<br>
Other than that they contribute in the common deco and the staging of the informals in ae-lawns. They also organize and handle the arrangements of Family Fortune, a great funny, entertaining game only to be attended if you ARE 18+.
