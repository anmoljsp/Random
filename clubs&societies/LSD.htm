<p style="font-family:chiller;color:white;font-size:30px;"><b><font color="red" size="120%">LSD(Let’s Start Dance)- </font></b>Well the most popular of the three dance groups of the college, the dance group is a freestyle dance groups. Given consideration to the performances of the two freestyle groups over the past year, LSD is comfortably much better than SUC. LSD is a very closely knit group whose biggest strength is their bonding.<br>
The demands of the group are very toiling and it doesn’t matter whether you are having your mid sems next day, you just can’t say no to a LSD dance practice. The group has the most dance practices, meetings and parties. It just seems to have paid as they have finally have ended the domination of SUC in GROOVE ARMADA as they won it last year.<br>
