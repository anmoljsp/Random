<p style="color:white;font-size:30px;font-family:chiller;"> It is a campus extension of the Art of Living foundation of Shri Shri Ravi Shankar. It is not a full-fledged full time society but is only concerned with the conduction of a workshop called Yes+. It happens in both the semesters.<br>
Even though it doesn't have a major existence in the college during most year, it is the part of the Social and Cultural society in conjunction with Rooh and Shiksha.<br>To know more about the organisation and their mission, you can check the website of Art of Living here @ <a href="http://www.artofliving.org/in-en" target="_new" class="class3">Art of Living.</a></p>
