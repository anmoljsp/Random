For Altius 2k17


The following project is an experimental and learning project built by us for the purpose of Altius 2k17. The project aims at creating a platform to offer the students of NIT Kurukshetra, both existing and those who seek to know more about their future college, a deep and candid insight. The website aims at providing a view sharing platform(under development) to the students of the college about the simple things that affect our daily lives like any new restraunts someone checked or a movie that needs to be must-watched or a trip to be planned for all.


The whole project is built using the HTML5 web framework while its styling is done with CSS3. The website is completely responsive to all screens of varying sizes.

The homepage goes by the name A0.htm
