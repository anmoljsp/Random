<p style="font-family:chiller;color:white;font-size:30px;"><b><font color="red" size="120%">NBC(NIT's Bhangra Crew)- </font></b>The only traditional dance group of the college, they don’t have any competition from within the college and are the unchallenged winners of the college. But in toghetherness, they pale to LSD and SUC in group dance competitons.<br>
Though to be fare to them, they are the winners of GROOVE ARMADA for traditional groups where colleges from all over North India came and there was a bhangra group from Punjab to compete as well.
