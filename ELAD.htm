<font color="red" size="120%">ELAD(English Literary and Debating Club):</font><p style="font-family:chiller;color:white;font-size:30px;"> The name speaks it all. They are the angrej around you. They will be hosting the events along with HLAD. Though I strongly believe someone needs to tell them that hosting an event with one speaking pure English and one pure Hindi is no music to ears. And more often then not they get ignored.<BR>
Still they are good at what they do and a knowledgeable lot as well. They prepare the reports of the events of the college, host various official college events, participate in Informals and host debates and quizzes during Confluence.
